                        <br>We started with a brief introduction to programming. We discussed the general steps involved in programming and explained how complex software, like 
                        games and apps, is made up of small, relatively simple codes. In other words, we demistified coding. We also addressed 
                        a common misconception in computer science—that the focus should be on learning programming languages rather than on 
                        analytical thinking and problem-solving. We emphasized that coding is mainly about solving problems, and programming 
                        languages are just tools to help achieve that.<br>As recommended in instructions we used Classic Maze puzzle.We displayed 
                        the puzles on a projector so everyone could see the board and participate in problem-solving. First, we explained the meaning 
                        of each block, how they function, and how to connect them. To be completely honest, we simply asked what they thought those blocks 
                        meant, and they were able to explain blocks like 'irəli get' and 'sağa dön' accurately<br>After solving the first maze problem, we 
                        discussed what happens in the background, like what makes the character move forward when "Run" is pressed. We showed them the 
                        JavaScript code and briefly explained the difference between syntax and semantics. As we solved more problems, we introduced 
                        the concept of sequence in coding. We demonstrated this with the 3rd problem by intentionally placing the correct blocks in 
                        the wrong order to show the incorrect output. Then, we arranged the blocks correctly, highlighting that the sequence of commands 
                        is just as important as using the correct blocks.<br>Next, we introduced a more complex topic: loops. We explained what a loop is, 
                        gave real-life examples, and discussed how programmers use loops to avoid repetitive code. We also explained the difference between 
                        counted and conditional loops. Using the 7th and 18th problems in the Classic Maze, we demonstrated which type of loop is best suited 
                        for different tasks. In the 18th problem, we also introduced conditional statements, showing how conditions can influence decisions 
                        in both real life and programming. This exercise helped teach the basics of control flow.<br>The kids thoroughly enjoyed the event. 
                        Even though the session ended and their parents were waiting, many of them didn't want to leave and asked if we could come back for 
                        another session. Some of them even ran to their parants and said those teachers(pointing at us) tought us lots of things and they were 
                        genuinely excited and happy about the experience they gained. Their progress was impressive. We hadn't expected them to grasp everything 
                        so quickly. After a single explanation, they answered our questions with ease and solved challenging problems involving loops and conditions, 
                        like the 18th problem, through effective brainstorming

                    As our community, we chose Baku Secondary School No. 242 for our event, where we engaged with a total of 33 enthusiastic 
                    3rd-grade pupils. Their energy and active participation made the event a truly memorable experience. We would also like 
                    to extend our heartfelt thanks to the school's director, Sevinc Bayramova, and to  teachers, Gunay Ehmedova and Beyim Guliyeva. 
                    Their support was invaluable. Teachers Gunay and Beyim kindly stepped in to help us manage the class when needed, while Ms. 
                    Bayramova graciously granted us permission to conduct the Hour of Code event at the school.
